Regression models (both linear and non-linear) are used for predicting a real value. 
If your independent variable is time, then you are forecasting future values, otherwise your model is predicting present but unknown values. 

Machine Learning Regression models:
- Simple Linear Regression
- Multiple Linear Regression
- Polynomial Regression
- Support Vector for Regression (SVR)
- Decision Tree Regression
- Random Forest Regression
