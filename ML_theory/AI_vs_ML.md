# Artificial intelligence (AI) vs. machine learning (ML)

## What is artificial intelligence?
Artificial intelligence is the use of technologies to build machines and computers that have the ability to mimic cognitive functions associated with human intelligence, such as being able to see, understand, and respond to spoken or written language, analyze data, make recommendations, and more. 
Although artificial intelligence is often thought of as a system in itself, it is a set of technologies implemented in a system to enable it to reason, learn, and act to solve a complex problem. 

## What is machine learning?
Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that automatically enables a machine or system to learn and improve from experience. Instead of explicit programming, machine learning uses algorithms to analyze large amounts of data, learn from the insights, and then make informed decisions. Machine learning algorithms improve performance over time as they are trainedâ€”exposed to more data. Machine learning models are the output, or what the program learns from running an algorithm on training data. The more data used, the better the model will get. 

## 
- AI is the broader concept of enabling a machine or system to sense, reason, act, or adapt like a human 
- ML is an application of AI that allows machines to extract knowledge from data and learn from it autonomously


While artificial intelligence encompasses the idea of a machine that can mimic human intelligence, machine learning does not. Machine learning aims to teach a machine how to perform a specific task and provide accurate results by identifying patterns.
